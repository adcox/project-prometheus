# Project Prometheus
A space invaders game thematically based on the popular TV show Stargate SG-1. The progression of levels follows the general story of the show; initially, you battle Goa'uld aliens. After defeating that race, you face increasingly difficult foes: first, the Replicators, next, the Ori.
